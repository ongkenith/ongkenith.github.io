                <p class="bio_info">
                    Current Year 2 undergraduate studying Information Systems at Singapore Management University (SMU). I love Wushu, its culture and many performance routines I learn, that I have been mastering this Chinese martial arts craft for more than 10 years. <br><br>
                    As seen above, my favourite travel destination is Hokkaido, Japan, especially during winter time. The snowy scenary and cold weather is amazing and something not possible in Singapore.
